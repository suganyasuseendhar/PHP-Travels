why we need selenium in testNG








TestNG flow of execution:

/*
 * BeforeSuite
 * BeforeTest
 * BeforeClass
 * BeforeMethod
 * Test
 * AfterMethod
 * AfterClass
 * AfterTest
 * AfterSuite  
 * 
 * for 100 test cases, 2 Tests (Sanity and Smoke), 10 Classes
 * 1 BS
 * 2 BT (Once for each test group)
 * 10 BC (once for each Class)
 * 100 BM
 * 100 @Test
 * 100 AM
 * 10 AC
 * 2 AT
 * 1 AS

how @Test method executed??
@Test method executed in alphabatical order
           
            testcase 1
            testcase 2
            testcase 3
            
            in this case testcase name are same so it will follow numerical value

Different attributes available in testNG:
          1)priority setting
          2)Enabled
          3)Deponds on method
          4)alwaysRun=true

1) priority setting:

@Test (Priority = 1)
@Test (Priority = 2)
@Test (Priority = 3)
    based on the prriority it will run.

2) Enabled : 
@Test (Priority = 1 Enabled = false)
   @Test method is literally is True
   @Test Enabled = true
   @Test Enabled = false (don't want to run particular test case we will put  @Test Enabled = false;)
   
3) Deponds on method:
@Test(dependsOnMethods = "testCase2" )
   making a test deponds on another test case.deponds on methods holds higher priority then priority.
   so Deponds on method it will exectuted immediately executed after particular testcase.
   
   
4) alwaysRun=true;
@Test(priority = 2, alwaysRun=true)
   the test will failure also the test will executed. @Test (Priority = 1 Enabled = false alwaysRun=true) 
   is won't run 
   
   
 note: 

        WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
		driver= new ChromeDriver();
		
 WebDriverManager will launch chromedriver
 selenium 4.6.0 we will directly use chrome driver:
 driver.close(); will current working window
 driver.quit(); will quit all the browser window that have been on the particular driver.
 
 Groups:
 grouping a set of similar test case we will ececuted. ex: facebook,google dailybases sanity suite (for production website)
 at regular intervel of time. because they will check the flow execution is correct without any errror.
 groups will come with @Test methods (groups= {"sanity"})
 @Test (groups= {"regression","sanity"}) two are more testcaes will follow the same test
 
 
 how to create testNG.xml:
 
 select what are the class we have right click====> convert =========>convert to Testng xml file
 
 specified groups into two level:
 1)suite level
 2)Test level
       <suite>
          <test>
            <classes>
                <class> @test methods will run</class>
            </classes>
          </test>
       </suite>
 suite level: suite level is the super set of everything. common to everything. 
 
   syntax for xml classes writting: packagename.classname
   ex:testnglearning.GroupSocial
   
   <Groups>
       <Run>
            <include name="sanity"/> 
             <exclude name="sanity"/> // exclude methods in 
       </Run>
   </Groups>

alwaysRun = true;(it dosenot follow any )
